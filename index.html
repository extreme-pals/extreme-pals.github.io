        <h3>Extreme PALS</h3>
        <p>
            Want to enter an official hackathon but feeling daunted by its unfamiliarity?
            Well, Extreme PALS is for you!
            <br>
            This hackathon will run over one whole day for 12 hours with breaks for a workshop and lunch.
            Participants, in small teams of up to 3-4 people,
            can stand a chance to win prizes by creating a game together based on a provided theme and framework.
            <br>Extreme PALS has the support of Volker Seeker, the lecturer for object oriented programming, a
            compulsory course for first year computer science students. By integrating the material with his course
            syllabus, you can level-up your Java skills with some hands-on experience.
            See this as an introduction to your hackathon journey.
        </p>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
            The primary goal of Extreme PALS is to introduce students with limited programming experience to
            programming events in a friendly way.
            <br>
            Extreme PALS wants to bolster participants’ confidence in their abilities, encouraging them to
            engage with events outside of the academic curriculum and inspiring them to develop their own ideas.
            As InfPALS leaders, we hope that this event will give the scheme lots of exposure and make a
            positive impression, which may contribute to the growth of the InfPALS scheme in the coming academic
            year.
        </p>
