# Game Development Path

## You've gone through the advanced guides - what now

Here is a list of ideas and further reading articles that might help you to find some inspiration and hopefully learn a thing or two.

1. The movement of the game character is based on constant displacement
    A much more realistic implementation would use acceleration - gravity is not linear and neither is motion in general.

    Here is a good post to start reading about how to add acceleration to movement: [Acceleration based player movement][stackexhange-post]

    Beyond this, this post has more advanced discussion on the topic: [Simple physics based movement][stackoverflow-post]

    Finally, if you are happy with nitty gritty details, this guide is excellent in discussing various approaches: [Integration Basics][gafferon-games-article]

2. Game panels are being repainted every frame
    It would be much more efficient to only redraw the parts of the screen that have actually changed.

    You will probably want to look at what happens when `gamePanel.repaintGame()` is called.
    Hint: the `paintComponent` functions in PlayPanel and StatsPanel are closely linked to it.

    First, it will be useful to know about double buffering: [Wikipedia article][wikipedia-double-buffering]

    The OSDev Wiki has a more detailed article about the same concept with some code examples: [OSDev article][osdev-double-buffering]

    Java Swing components are double buffered by default, but not perfectly so.
    This [StackOverflow page][stackoverflow-swing-painting] has some amazing suggestions for how to improve it.

3. The game needs some cool stuff!
   Use your imagination for this one.

   How about some NPCs (Non Playable Characters)? What about a cute little dog that follows you around?
   How about some enemies that you can fight or have to run away from?
   How about a jetpack that the character could fly with?

   You will have to collaborate with your teammates to make these ideas come to life, so share what you have learned with them and see what they can teach you!

Here is a portal back to the index page.
If you feel like you have learned everything you could here or are just curious, you are more than welcome to explore the other advanced paths :3
