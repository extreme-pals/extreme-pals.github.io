```java
// Called every time the player presses the jump key
// Does nothing if the character is already jumping or falling
public void startJumping() {
    if (!jumping && !falling) {
        jumping = true;

        // Reinitialise the jump_count, useful to determine for how 
        // Much time the character is going to stay in the air
        jump_count = 0;

        // Sets the current jumping frame based on the last direction
        if (facingDirection == KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT) {
            currentFrame = run_R[2];
        } else {
            currentFrame = run_L[2];
        }
    }
}
